"""
    fix_travis(dir = "")

Read `joinpath(dir, ".travis.yml")` and add the current julia stable versions.
Returns `true` if modifications were made (and thus a commit is necessary) and
`false` if either all stable versions are being tested or the package is not
testing in any stable version because it believes it's inactive. If the folder
is dirty, the modification is not made and `false` is returned.
